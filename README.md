# Residual Analysis for Regression Models

This Python project contains the `ResidualAnalysis` class, designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of residuals from regression models. The class offers a range of functionalities, including statistical tests, visual plots, and diagnostic checks, to evaluate the performance of regression models.

## Features

- Summary statistics of residuals
- Residuals plot against observed values
- Normality check using Shapiro-Wilk test
- Histogram of residuals
- Autocorrelation check
- Homoscedasticity check
- Outlier identification
- Linearity check against each predictor
- Multicollinearity check using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation
- Leverage analysis
- Identification of influential observations
- Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity
- Detailed residual distribution analysis
- Quantile residual plot
- Plot of predicted vs. actual values

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
